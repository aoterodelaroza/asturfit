AsturFit is an octave package for fitting equation of state functions
to energy-volume and pressure-volume data in solids.

The ~/doc directory contains the documentation: asturfit.pdf and
asturfit.txt (plain ascii text written in reStructuredText
format). This includes instructions for installing the package,
examples of use, and a description of all routines.

The sources reside in the ~/src directory. A number of data sets,
example test scripts, and the output of the tests, can be found in the
~/test directory.
